# About 
This folder contains the task and steps taken to solve bandit. This repository has solution to the flags of each and every lesson but what makes this repository interesting is the fact that we have automated things as much as we can so, you just simply execute the python executable located at each folder and you get the output flag for the next level in a text file just copy paste the flag as password for the next .py file and execute to et the flag for the next file.
